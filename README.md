ToDo's
---------------
* **Actual Command Line Interface**
* <s>Grab Notes</s> *Not that useful, will think about it in the future(very few notes ever show up for me)!*
* <s>Prevent Overlapping! No Double Likes or Double Cools! or both!</s>
* Learn how to avoid graph API POST limits by doing requests concurrently (cool research area)
* Error Handling is non-existant

* Create a Gem!
